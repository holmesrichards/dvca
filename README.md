## Submodules

This repo uses submodules aoKicad and Kosmo_panel, which provide needed libaries for KiCad. To clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:holmesrichards/dvca.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```


Alternatively do

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:holmesrichards/dvca.git
```

Or if you download the repository as a zip file, you must also click on the "aoKicad" and "Kosmo\_panel" links on the GitHub page (they'll be in the Libraries folder and will have "@ something" after them) and download them as separate zip files which you can unzip into this repo's aoKicad and Kosmo\_panel directories (in the Libraries folder).

If desired, copy the files from aoKicad and Kosmo\_panel to wherever you prefer. 

Then in KiCad, go into Edit Symbols and add symbol libraries 

```
aoKicad/AO_symbols
Kosmo_panel/Kosmo
```
and go into Edit Footprints and add footprint libraries 
```
aoKicad/AO_tht
Kosmo_panel/Kosmo_panel.
```
